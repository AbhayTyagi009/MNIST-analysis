# MNIST Analysis
So, I started from the basics. I wanted to analyse the MNIST dataset and the efficiency of various machine learning algorithms in classifying the handwritten digits. The results were as follows:

* Logistic Regression: 0.9218
* Stochastic Gradient Descent: 0.8844
* SVM: DNF
* Artificial Neural Network (MLP): 0.939
* CNN: 0.9924
* Decision Tree: 0.8768
* Random Forest: 0.9285

I was surprised by the performance of the trees and random forest algorithms.
